            <p className="introText">Hello! Welcome! My name is Daniel Juarez, and I am glad that you are here. I am a junior developer for Enok Collective starting in 2022. I completed training at an awesome school call Carolina Code School, where I completed their full-stack immersive course. But where did I start? I actually was a Product Manager and Technical Account Manager at Enok Collective for 3 year. Though, this was a great position, it did not fulfill my urge for continued improvment, problem-solving, and creativitey in that way I would like. I still had a love for the tech industry and becomming a software engineer seemed like a create move. A year later, I have no regrets and my journey of learning continues to grow and blosum. Feel free to travel around my site to learn more about me. I also would love to connect with you on social media!!! Browse my projects and let me know if you have questions, or feedback. I look forward to hearing you!!</p>
